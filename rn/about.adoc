[.lead]
The documentation at this site describes the Astra Control REST API and related automation technologies included with the most recent releases of the two Astra Control deployment models.

[NOTE]
Every Astra Control release is assigned a version number of the form *YY.MM*. This value identities the version based on the year (_YY_) and month (_MM_) it became available. For example, Astra Control Center 23.04 was released in April 2023.

.Release cadence

In general, updates to Astra Control Service and Astra Control Center occur at the same time. However, Astra Control Service has an accelerated release cadence that can result in one or more incremental updates beyond the most recent Astra Control Center version.

Because this site documents the REST API for both deployment models, there may be some features only available with the most recent Astra Control Service release. Any differences between the two deployment models are noted as needed.

.Astra Control deployments

The documentation at this site applies to the following Astra Control releases:

* Astra Control Service 23.06
